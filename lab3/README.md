Individual portion

I'm using a public github repository for my labs and homeworks at <https://github.com/adrianamorales/ITWS4200>. 
I gave <rplotka@tsi400.com> access to the repo and included instructions and further info in the other readme for 
the github repo.

Group Portion

Our team has set up a public github repository for our project (Codename Shirley's Scheduler, the name will change)
at <https://github.com/hamlim/ShirleysScheduler>. Each members has read/write access to the repo. Each team member 
will have a branch that merges into the master as they become functional. By default, we will be using the Github bug 
tracking to keep track of issues. 

As for hosting, we will be using MyRPI hosting server at <http://aarmea.myrpi.org>. We may change to a different server
in the near future and will contact asap.
